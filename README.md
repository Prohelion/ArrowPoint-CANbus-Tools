# ArrowPoint-CANbus-Tools
The ArrowPoint CanBus Tools is a Windows based platform designed to receive and display telemetry information from an WiFi access point in real time.

The out of the box implementation is designed for use in Solar or Electric racing cars that use technology from 
Prohelion (www.prohelion.com) or Tritium (www.tritium.com.au).  This solution was origionally developed by TeamArrow (www.teamarrow.com.au)
and has been used in racing environments since 2015.  TeamArrow continue to use this application both as the in car dashboard as well as a solution for the entire fleet to communicate and monitor the car.

Documentation for the CANbus Tools can be found on the Prohelion Documentation site here
https://docs.prohelion.com

If you are interested in contributing to the solution, please see our contribution file here

The application provides

- The ability to view and transmit CANbus packets
- The ability to log CANbus packets and replay them
- Simulate a driver controller 
- Simulate a motor controller 

The application is compatible with
 
- Prohelion Battery Packs
- Prohelion and Tritium Driver Controllers
- Tritium WaveSculpters
- Tritium BMUs and CMUs

The Wifi connection should be broadcasting CANbus data using the Tritium CANbus identifiers.
